# Recipients Management Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Created a complete, dedicated Recipients Management page with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for saved recipients. This allows warehouse staff to manage delivery recipients separately from the shipment creation process.

## Files Created

- Centralized service for all recipient operations
- Methods:
  - `getAllRecipients(userId)` - Fetch all recipients
  - `createRecipient(userId, data)` - Create new recipient
  - `updateRecipient(userId, data)` - Update existing recipient
  - `deleteRecipient(userId, recipientId)` - Delete recipient
  - `setDefaultRecipient(userId, recipientId)` - Set as default
  - `getRecipientById(userId, recipientId)` - Get single recipient
  - `searchRecipients(userId, query)` - Search functionality

### 2. Page Component
**File:** `src/app/pages/Recipients/RecipientsManagement.tsx`

  - Dual mode: create or edit
  - International phone number input with PhoneInput component
  - Service type selection (standard/express/overnight)
  - Set as default toggle
  - Form validation

## Files Modified

### 1. App Routing
**File:** `src/App.tsx`
- Added import for `RecipientsManagement`
- Added route: `/recipients`
- Protected with `shipment_creation` permission
- Accessible by all warehouse roles who can create shipments

### 2. Navigation
**File:** `src/utils/permissions.ts`
- Added Recipients to navigation menu
- Shows for all roles with `shipment_creation` permission
- Icon: `FiBookmark`
- Position: After "Create Shipment", before "Delivery"

## Design Implementation

### Theme Consistency
✅ **Header Design:**
- Gradient: `from-red-600 via-red-700 to-red-800`
- Matches existing Vanguard Cargo theme
- White text with red-100 subtitle

✅ **Card Design:**
- White background with subtle shadow
- Rounded corners (rounded-2xl)
- Hover effect with increased shadow
- Border: gray-100

✅ **Color Coding:**
- Default recipients: Yellow gradient background header
- Location icon: Red
- Phone icon: Green
- Service type icon: Blue

✅ **Buttons:**
- Primary (Add/Create): Gradient red-600 to red-700
- Set Default: Yellow theme with star icon
- Edit: Blue theme
- Delete: Red theme
- All with hover effects and transitions

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Grid layout: 1 column (mobile) → 2 columns (tablet) → 3 columns (desktop)
- Padding and spacing adjust for screen sizes
- Modal scrolls on small screens

## User Experience Features

### Visual Indicators
1. **Default Recipient:**
   - Gold star icon (filled)
   - Yellow gradient header
   - "Set as Default" badge

2. **Usage Statistics:**
   - Shows how many times each recipient was used
   - Helps identify frequently used addresses

3. **Empty States:**
   - Friendly message when no recipients
   - Call-to-action button to add first recipient
   - Different message when search returns no results

### Search Functionality
- Real-time filtering
- Searches across:
  - Nickname
  - Recipient name
  - City
  - Country
- Case-insensitive
- Shows count of filtered results

### Form Validation
- Required fields marked with red asterisk (*)
- Inline error messages
- Prevents submission with invalid data
- Phone number: International format validation
- Service type: Dropdown selection (prevents typos)

## Database Schema Used

### Table: `saved_recipients`
```sql
- id (UUID, primary key)
- user_id (UUID, foreign key to users)
- nickname (TEXT) - Friendly name
- recipient_name (TEXT) - Full name
- recipient_phone (TEXT, nullable)
- delivery_address (TEXT)
- delivery_city (TEXT)
- delivery_country (TEXT)
- service_type (TEXT) - standard/express/overnight
- is_default (BOOLEAN) - Only one per user
- usage_count (INTEGER) - Tracked automatically
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
- updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

### RPC Functions Used
1. `get_saved_recipients(p_user_id)` - Already exists
2. `save_recipient(...)` - Already exists
3. `delete_saved_recipient(p_recipient_id, p_user_id)` - Already exists
4. `update_saved_recipient(...)` - **NEW** (created in this feature)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy SQL Function
```bash
# Connect to your Supabase project
# Run the SQL file
psql -h your-db-host -U postgres -d your_database -f sql/update_saved_recipient.sql

# OR via Supabase Dashboard:
# 1. Go to SQL Editor
# 2. Paste contents of sql/update_saved_recipient.sql
# 3. Run query
```

### 2. Test the Feature
1. Login as any warehouse role
2. Navigate to "Recipients" in sidebar
3. Click "Add Recipient"
4. Fill form and submit
5. Verify recipient appears in grid
6. Test edit, delete, and set default actions
7. Test search functionality

## Integration Points

### CreateShipment Page
- Recipients from this page appear in the CreateShipment dropdown
- Can be selected for quick form filling
- Can be deleted from CreateShipment (syncs with Recipients page)
- Usage count increments when used in shipment

### Permissions
- Requires `shipment_creation` permission
- Available to:
  - warehouse_admin ✅
  - admin ✅
