# 🚀 Deployment Guide: Delivery Authentication Code System

## 📋 Quick Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Step 1: Run SQL Migrations (In Order)
First, ensure the `total_packages` count fix is deployed:
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
/sql/61_fix_total_packages_count.sql
```

Then deploy the delivery auth code system:
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
/sql/62_delivery_auth_code_system.sql
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NOTICE:  ====================================
NOTICE:  DELIVERY AUTH CODE SYSTEM DEPLOYED
NOTICE:  ====================================
NOTICE:  Trigger installed: 1 (expected 1)
NOTICE:  Functions installed: 4 (expected 4)
```

### ✅ Step 2: Verify Database Changes
```sql
-- Check trigger exists
SELECT trigger_name, event_object_table 
FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_name = 'trigger_generate_delivery_codes';

-- Should return:
-- trigger_generate_delivery_codes | shipments

-- Check functions exist
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc 
WHERE proname IN (
    'generate_delivery_codes_on_arrival',
    'verify_delivery_code',
    'get_customer_delivery_codes',
    'generate_auth_code'
);

-- Should return 4 rows
```

### ✅ Step 3: Test Code Generation
```sql
-- Find a test shipment
SELECT id, tracking_number, status FROM shipments LIMIT 1;

-- Mark it as arrived (replace <shipment_id>)
UPDATE shipments 
SET status = 'arrived' 
WHERE id = '<shipment_id>';

-- Check if codes were generated
SELECT 
    p.package_id,
    p.delivery_auth_code,
    p.auth_code_generated_at,
    u.suite_number,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name
FROM packages p
JOIN users u ON p.user_id = u.id
WHERE p.linked_to_shipment_id = '<shipment_id>'
AND p.delivery_auth_code IS NOT NULL;

-- Should show 6-digit codes for all packages
```

### ✅ Step 4: Frontend Already Updated
The following files have been automatically updated:

**ShipmentHistory.tsx**
- ✅ Blocked `arrived → delivered` transition
- ✅ Comment added explaining why
- ✅ No "Mark Delivered" button for arrived shipments

**Delivery.tsx**
- ✅ Updated to use `delivery_auth_code` field
- ✅ Uses `verify_delivery_code()` function
- ✅ Simplified interface (removed expired codes, lock status)
- ✅ Clean verification flow

### ✅ Step 5: Test End-to-End Flow

#### Test Scenario 1: Happy Path ✅
```
1. Go to Shipment History
2. Find a shipment with status "in_transit"
3. Click "Mark Arrived"
4. ✓ Shipment changes to "arrived"
5. ✓ No "Mark Delivered" button appears
6. Go to Delivery page
7. ✓ Packages appear with "CODE READY" badge
8. Click "Verify & Deliver"
9. Enter correct suite number + code
10. ✓ Package marked as delivered
11. ✓ Success message shown
12. ✓ Package disappears from Delivery page
```

#### Test Scenario 2: Wrong Code ❌
```
1. Go to Delivery page
2. Click "Verify & Deliver" on a package
3. Enter correct suite number
4. Enter WRONG 6-digit code
5. ✓ Verification fails
6. ✓ Error message: "Invalid delivery code"
7. ✓ Package remains in "arrived" status
8. ✓ Attempt logged in package_verification_log
```

#### Test Scenario 3: Code Reuse Prevention 🔒
```
1. Successfully deliver a package (use correct code)
2. Try to verify the same package again with same code
3. ✓ Verification fails
4. ✓ Error: "Delivery code already used - package already delivered"
5. ✓ Cannot re-deliver package
```

## 🔧 Configuration Required

### For Client App Development
The client app needs to implement code retrieval:

```typescript
// In Customer Dashboard or Package Details page
const fetchDeliveryCodes = async (userId: string) => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .rpc('get_customer_delivery_codes', {
      p_user_id: userId
    });
    
  if (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch delivery codes:', error);
    return;
  }
  
  // Display codes to customer
  data.forEach(pkg => {
    console.log(`Package ${pkg.package_id}: Code ${pkg.delivery_code}`);
  });
};
```

**Example UI Display:**
```jsx
{deliveryCodes.map(pkg => (
  <div key={pkg.package_id} className="package-card">
    <h3>{pkg.package_id}</h3>
    <p>Tracking: {pkg.tracking_number}</p>
    <p>Shipment: {pkg.shipment_tracking}</p>
    <div className="delivery-code">
      <label>Your Delivery Code:</label>
      <h1>{pkg.delivery_code}</h1>
      <p>Show this code to warehouse staff</p>
    </div>
  </div>
))}
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Maintenance

### Daily Monitoring Queries

**Check codes generated today:**
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as packages_with_codes,
    COUNT(DISTINCT delivery_auth_code) as unique_codes
FROM packages
WHERE auth_code_generated_at::date = CURRENT_DATE;
```

**Verification success rate:**
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_attempts,
    SUM(CASE WHEN verification_success THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as successful,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN verification_success THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as success_rate
FROM package_verification_log
WHERE verified_at >= CURRENT_DATE;
```

**Failed attempts by reason:**
```sql
SELECT 
    failure_reason,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM package_verification_log
WHERE verification_success = false
AND verified_at >= CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY failure_reason
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Codes not generating when marking shipment as arrived

**Diagnosis:**
```sql
-- Check if trigger exists
SELECT * FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_name = 'trigger_generate_delivery_codes';
```

**Solution:**
Re-run `62_delivery_auth_code_system.sql`

---

### Issue: Customer can't see delivery codes in app

**Diagnosis:**
```sql
-- Check function permissions
SELECT has_function_privilege('authenticated', 'get_customer_delivery_codes(uuid)', 'EXECUTE');
```

**Solution:**
```sql
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION get_customer_delivery_codes(UUID) TO authenticated;
```

---

### Issue: Verification always fails with "Suite number mismatch"

**Diagnosis:**
Suite numbers must be uppercase in database.

**Solution:**
Check suite number format:
```sql
SELECT id, suite_number FROM users WHERE id = '<user_id>';
```

Ensure frontend converts to uppercase:
```typescript
p_suite_number: verifySuiteNumber.trim().toUpperCase()
```

---

### Issue: Package showing "NO CODE" in Delivery page

**Diagnosis:**
```sql
-- Check if package has code
SELECT 
    package_id,
    status,
    delivery_auth_code,
    auth_code_generated_at,
    linked_to_shipment_id
FROM packages
WHERE package_id = '<package_id>';
```

**Possible Causes:**
1. Shipment not marked as "arrived" yet
2. Trigger didn't fire
3. Package not linked to shipment

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Manually mark shipment as arrived again
UPDATE shipments 
SET status = 'in_transit' 
WHERE id = '<shipment_id>';

UPDATE shipments 
SET status = 'arrived' 
WHERE id = '<shipment_id>';
-- This should trigger code generation
```

---

## 📝 Rollback Plan (Emergency)

If something goes wrong and you need to rollback:

```sql
-- 1. Disable trigger
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_generate_delivery_codes ON shipments;

-- 2. Remove verification function
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS verify_delivery_code(UUID, TEXT, TEXT, UUID);

-- 3. Restore old workflow (allow arrived → delivered in UI)
-- Edit ShipmentHistory.tsx line 224:
-- Change: arrived: null
-- Back to: arrived: 'delivered'
```

**Note:** This will break the security workflow! Only use in emergency.

    trigger_count INTEGER;
    function_count INTEGER;
    packages_with_codes INTEGER;
    recent_verifications INTEGER;

    FROM information_schema.triggers
    WHERE trigger_name = 'trigger_generate_delivery_codes';
    
    -- Check functions
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO function_count
    FROM pg_proc
    WHERE proname IN (
        'generate_delivery_codes_on_arrival',
        'verify_delivery_code',
        'get_customer_delivery_codes',
        'generate_auth_code'
    );
    
    -- Check codes
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO packages_with_codes
    FROM packages
    WHERE delivery_auth_code IS NOT NULL
    AND status = 'arrived';
    
    -- Check recent activity
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO recent_verifications
    FROM package_verification_log
    WHERE verified_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
    
    RAISE NOTICE '════════════════════════════════════════';
    RAISE NOTICE ' DELIVERY AUTH CODE SYSTEM STATUS';
    RAISE NOTICE '════════════════════════════════════════';
    RAISE NOTICE 'Trigger Installed: % (expect: 1)', trigger_count;
    RAISE NOTICE 'Functions Installed: % (expect: 4)', function_count;
    RAISE NOTICE 'Packages with Codes: %', packages_with_codes;
    RAISE NOTICE 'Verifications (7 days): %', recent_verifications;
    RAISE NOTICE '════════════════════════════════════════';
    
    IF trigger_count = 1 AND function_count = 4 THEN
        RAISE NOTICE '✅ SYSTEM READY FOR PRODUCTION';
    ELSE
        RAISE NOTICE '❌ SYSTEM NOT PROPERLY CONFIGURED';
    END IF;
END $$;
