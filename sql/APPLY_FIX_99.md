# How to Apply Shipment Delivery Status Fix (99_fix_shipment_delivery_status.sql)

## Issue Fixed
**Shipments showing as 'arrived' in Shipment History even after all packages are delivered**

## What This Fix Does
- ✅ Automatically updates shipment status to 'delivered' when all packages in the shipment are delivered
- ✅ Fixes existing shipments that have all packages delivered but are stuck in 'arrived' status
- ✅ Maintains proper status synchronization between packages and shipments

---

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Access Supabase SQL Editor
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard: https://app.supabase.com
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Click **New Query** to create a new SQL query

### Step 2: Run the Fix Script
1. Open the file: `sql/99_fix_shipment_delivery_status.sql`
2. Copy the **entire contents** of the file
3. Paste into the Supabase SQL Editor
4. Click **Run** (or press Ctrl/Cmd + Enter)

### Step 3: Verify the Fix
The script will output messages showing:
- ✅ Function updated successfully
- ✅ Number of shipments fixed (if any had inconsistent status)
- ✅ Details of each shipment that was corrected

**Example Output:**
```
✅ verify_delivery_code() function updated with shipment status fix
When all packages in a shipment are delivered, shipment status will automatically update to delivered

NOTICE:  FIXED: Shipment SH251234 (uuid) - 3/3 packages delivered
NOTICE:  ✅ Fixed 1 shipment(s) with inconsistent status
```

## What Gets Fixed

### 1. The verify_delivery_code() Function
- **Before:** Only updated package status to 'delivered'
- **After:** Updates package status AND checks if all packages in shipment are delivered
- **New Behavior:** If all packages delivered → automatically updates shipment to 'delivered'

### 2. Existing Data
The script includes a data migration that:
- Finds all shipments where `status != 'delivered'` but all packages are delivered
- Updates those shipments to `status = 'delivered'`
- Logs each fix in the output

---

## Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Check Shipment History
1. Go to **Shipment History** page
2. Find a shipment that was previously showing as 'arrived' but had delivered packages
3. Refresh the page
4. ✅ Status should now show as **'Delivered'** (green badge)

### Test 2: Deliver a New Package
1. Go to **Delivery** page
2. Verify and deliver a package using the 6-digit code
3. If this was the last package in a shipment:
   - Go to **Shipment History**
   - Find that shipment
   - ✅ Status should automatically be **'Delivered'**

---

## Rollback (If Needed)

If you need to undo this change, you can restore the previous version:

1. Open SQL Editor in Supabase
2. Run the previous version from: `sql/85_add_delivery_notification.sql`
3. This will restore the function without the shipment status update logic

**Note:** Shipment statuses that were already updated will remain as 'delivered' - you would need to manually correct them if needed.

## Technical Details

### What Changed in the Code

**Old Logic (lines 133-139 in 85_add_delivery_notification.sql):**
```sql
UPDATE packages
SET 
    status = 'delivered',
    auth_code_used_at = NOW(),
    auth_code_used_by = p_staff_id,
    updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = p_package_id;
-- ❌ No shipment update
```

**New Logic (added after line 139):**
```sql
-- Update package status (same as before)
UPDATE packages SET status = 'delivered' WHERE id = p_package_id;

-- ✅ NEW: Check if all packages delivered
IF v_shipment_id IS NOT NULL THEN
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO v_total_packages
    FROM packages WHERE linked_to_shipment_id = v_shipment_id;
    
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO v_delivered_packages
    FROM packages 
    WHERE linked_to_shipment_id = v_shipment_id 
    AND status = 'delivered';
    
    -- If all delivered, update shipment
    IF v_delivered_packages = v_total_packages THEN
        UPDATE shipments SET status = 'delivered' WHERE id = v_shipment_id;
    END IF;
END IF;
```
