# 🔐 Delivery Authentication Code System

## Overview
The Delivery Authentication Code System provides secure package delivery verification through unique 6-digit codes. When a shipment arrives, each customer receives a unique code that must be verified before their packages can be marked as delivered.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **Auto-Generated Codes**
- ✅ **Unique 6-digit code PER PACKAGE** (each package has its own code)
- ✅ Automatically generated when shipment status changes to "arrived"
- ✅ If customer has 10 packages, they get 10 different codes
- ✅ Codes are **NOT encrypted** - customers can see the real code

### 2. **Secure Delivery Process**
- ✅ Customers receive code in their client app
- ✅ Staff must verify code + suite number before delivery
- ✅ All verification attempts logged for security
- ✅ Codes cannot be reused after successful delivery

### 3. **Workflow Enforcement**
- ✅ Shipments cannot be marked as "delivered" from Shipment History
- ✅ `arrived → delivered` transition blocked in UI
- ✅ Delivery MUST happen through Delivery page with code verification

## 📊 Database Schema

### Tables Modified

#### **packages**
```sql
delivery_auth_code          TEXT                        -- 6-digit code (plain text)
auth_code_generated_at      TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE    -- When code was generated
auth_code_used_at           TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE    -- When code was used
auth_code_used_by           UUID                        -- Staff who verified delivery
```

#### **package_verification_log**
Logs all verification attempts (success and failure) for audit trail.

---

## 🔄 Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Shipment Arrival
```
Staff marks shipment as "arrived" in Shipment History
    ↓
Trigger: generate_delivery_codes_on_arrival()
    ↓
For each package in shipment:
    - Generate unique 6-digit code for THIS PACKAGE
    - Update package with its unique code
    - Set status to "arrived"
    - Record generation timestamp
    ↓
Example: 10 packages = 10 unique codes generated
```

### Step 2: Customer Notification
```
Customer opens client app
    ↓
Call: get_customer_delivery_codes(user_id)
    ↓
Customer sees ALL their packages with individual codes:
    - Package 1: Code 847293
    - Package 2: Code 529184
    - Package 3: Code 301847
    - (Each package has its own unique code)
```

### Step 3: Package Delivery
```
Customer arrives at warehouse with codes for their packages
    ↓
Staff opens Delivery page
    ↓
Staff clicks "Verify & Deliver" for FIRST package
    ↓
Customer provides code for THAT specific package
    ↓
Staff enters:
    - Suite number
    - 6-digit code (for THIS package)
    ↓
Call: verify_delivery_code()
    ↓
Verification checks:
    ✓ Suite number matches
    ✓ Code matches THIS package
    ✓ Code not already used
    ✓ Package status is "arrived"
    ↓
Success:
    - This package marked as "delivered"
    - Code marked as used
    - Timestamp recorded
    - Staff ID logged
    - 📄 AUTO-GENERATE DELIVERY RECEIPT
    - 🖨️ AUTO-PRINT RECEIPT (with arrival date)
    ↓
Receipt contains:
    - VanguardCargo branding & logo
    - Customer & package details
    - Package arrival date/time
    - Delivery date/time
    - "VERIFIED & RELEASED" stamp
    - Watermark for authenticity
    ↓
Repeat for each package (each has different code)
    ↓
Failure:
    - Attempt logged
    - Error message displayed
    - Package remains "arrived"
```

## 📄 Auto-Generated Delivery Receipts

### **What Happens After Successful Verification**

When staff successfully verifies a delivery code, the system automatically:

1. ✅ **Generates Professional Receipt**
   - Unique receipt number: `DLV-YYYYMMDD-XXXXXX`
   - VanguardCargo branding and logo
   - Complete customer information
   - Full package details

2. 📅 **Includes Important Dates**
   - **Package Arrival Date** - When shipment arrived at warehouse
   - **Delivery Date** - Current date/time of handover
   - All timestamps in readable format

3. 🎨 **Professional Branding**
   - VanguardCargo logo at top
   - Company information (address, email, phone)
   - "VANGUARDCARGO" watermark (45° angle, subtle)
   - Red accent colors matching brand

4. ✅ **Delivery Confirmation Stamp**
   - Large green "VERIFIED & RELEASED" badge
   - Customer name and suite number
   - Confirms code verification

5. 🖨️ **Auto-Print Behavior**
   - Opens print dialog automatically
   - No manual "Print" button needed
   - Receipt window closes after printing
   - Clean, print-optimized layout

### **Receipt Sections**

| Section | Contains |
|---------|----------|
| **Header** | Logo, company info, receipt number, generation date |
| **Customer Info** | Name, suite, email, phone |
| **Package Details** | Package ID, tracking #, description, weight |
| **Delivery Info** | Arrival date, delivery date, status |
| **Confirmation** | "VERIFIED & RELEASED" stamp with customer details |
| **Footer** | Thank you message, contact info, copyright |

### **Example Receipt Flow**

```
1. Staff enters code "847293"
2. System verifies ✅
3. Receipt auto-generates with:
   - Arrived: October 7, 2025 at 9:00 PM
   - Delivered: October 7, 2025 at 11:30 PM
4. Print dialog opens automatically
5. Staff clicks "Print" on dialog
6. Customer receives printed receipt
7. Modal closes, page refreshes
```

## 🛠️ SQL Functions

### 1. `generate_delivery_codes_on_arrival()`
**Trigger Function** - Automatically runs when shipment status → "arrived"

```sql
-- Generates unique codes per customer
-- Updates all packages from same customer with same code
-- Logs code generation
```

### 2. `verify_delivery_code(p_package_id, p_suite_number, p_auth_code, p_staff_id)`
**Verification Function** - Called from Delivery page

```sql
-- Verifies suite number + auth code
-- Marks package as delivered on success
-- Logs all attempts
-- Returns JSONB with verification result
```

### 3. `get_customer_delivery_codes(p_user_id)`
**Customer App Function** - Retrieves codes for customer

```sql
-- Returns all arrived packages with codes
-- Shows package details
-- Used by client mobile/web app
```

---

## 💻 Frontend Implementation

### ShipmentHistory.tsx
```typescript
// Blocked transition: arrived → delivered
arrived: null, // Must use Delivery page

// When "Mark Arrived" clicked:
updateShipmentStatus(shipmentId, 'arrived')
  ↓
Trigger fires in database
  ↓
Codes auto-generated for all customers
```

### Delivery.tsx
```typescript
// Fetches packages with delivery codes
delivery_auth_code          // The 6-digit code
auth_code_generated_at      // When code was created
has_delivery_code           // Boolean flag

// Verification call
supabase.rpc('verify_delivery_code', {
  p_package_id: packageId,
  p_suite_number: suiteNumber,
  p_auth_code: code,
  p_staff_id: userId
})
```

---

## 🔒 Security Features

### 1. **Audit Logging**
- Every verification attempt logged
- Tracks: package, suite number, code entered, success/failure
- Records staff member, timestamp, failure reason

### 2. **One-Time Use**
- Code can only be used once
- After successful delivery, code is invalidated
- Prevents duplicate deliveries

### 3. **Suite Number Verification**
- Code alone is not enough
- Must also match customer's suite number
- Prevents unauthorized pickups

### 4. **Status Validation**
- Package must be in "arrived" status
- Cannot deliver packages still in transit
- Cannot re-deliver already delivered packages

---

## 📱 Client App Integration

### API Endpoint for Customers
```typescript
// Get delivery codes for logged-in customer
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .rpc('get_customer_delivery_codes', {
    p_user_id: userId
  });

// Response:
[
  {
    package_id: "PKG-123456",
    tracking_number: "VC123456789",
    delivery_code: "847293",  // <- Customer sees this
    shipment_tracking: "VC251007KHXVQ0I",
    status: "arrived",
    generated_at: "2025-10-07T21:00:00Z"
  }
]
```

### Display in Client App
```
╔══════════════════════════════════════╗
║  Your Package is Ready for Pickup!  ║

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Happy Path
```sql
1. Mark shipment as arrived
2. Verify codes generated in packages table
3. Check customer can retrieve code
4. Staff verifies code successfully
5. Package marked as delivered
```

### Test Scenario 2: Wrong Code
```sql
1. Customer provides wrong code
2. Verification fails
3. Attempt logged in verification_log
4. Package remains "arrived"
5. Error message shown to staff
```

### Test Scenario 3: Code Reuse Prevention
```sql
1. Verify code successfully (package delivered)
2. Try to use same code again
3. Verification fails: "Code already used"
4. Cannot deliver same package twice
```

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

### Database
- ✅ Run `61_fix_total_packages_count.sql` (if not already run)
- ✅ Run `62_delivery_auth_code_system.sql`
- ✅ Verify triggers installed
- ✅ Test code generation on sample shipment

### Frontend
- ✅ Update ShipmentHistory.tsx (blocked arrived → delivered)
- ✅ Update Delivery.tsx (use delivery_auth_code)
- ✅ Test verification flow end-to-end

### Client App
- ✅ Implement `get_customer_delivery_codes()` API call
- ✅ Display codes in customer dashboard
- ✅ Add notification when codes generated

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Codes not generated when shipment arrives
**Solution**: Check trigger is installed
```sql
SELECT * FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_name = 'trigger_generate_delivery_codes';
```

### Issue: Customer can't see their code
**Solution**: Check RLS policies allow customer access
```sql
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION get_customer_delivery_codes TO authenticated;
```

### Issue: Verification always fails
**Solution**: Check suite number format (must be uppercase)
```sql
-- Suite numbers stored as uppercase
-- Frontend converts to uppercase before sending
```

---

## 📊 Monitoring Queries

### Check codes generated today
```sql
SELECT 
    p.package_id,
    u.suite_number,
    p.delivery_auth_code,
    p.auth_code_generated_at,
    p.status
FROM packages p
JOIN users u ON p.user_id = u.id
WHERE p.auth_code_generated_at::date = CURRENT_DATE
ORDER BY p.auth_code_generated_at DESC;
```

### Verification success rate
```sql
SELECT 
    DATE(verified_at) as date,
    COUNT(*) as total_attempts,
    SUM(CASE WHEN verification_success THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as successful,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN verification_success THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as success_rate
FROM package_verification_log
WHERE verified_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(verified_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

### Failed verification reasons
```sql
SELECT 
    failure_reason,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM package_verification_log
WHERE verification_success = false
AND verified_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY failure_reason
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

## 🎓 Best Practices

### For Warehouse Staff
1. Always verify suite number matches customer ID
2. Never share codes with anyone except package owner
3. If customer lost code, verify identity before providing new code
4. Log all suspicious verification attempts

### For Development
1. Never encrypt/hash delivery codes (customers need to see them)
2. Always log verification attempts for audit trail
3. Maintain one code per customer (not per package)
4. Update client app immediately when codes generated

### For Security
1. Monitor failed verification attempts
2. Alert on multiple failed attempts from same staff
3. Review verification logs regularly
4. Rotate codes if security breach suspected
