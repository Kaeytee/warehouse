# 🔒 Secure Login Audit System - Complete Guide

## Overview

The VanguardCargo Warehouse system includes a comprehensive, enterprise-grade login audit system that tracks all authentication events with industry-standard security practices.

---

## 🎯 Features

### ✅ **Core Capabilities**
- **Complete Login Tracking** - Every login attempt (success & failure) is logged
- **User Activity Monitoring** - Track what users do and when

## 🚀 Deployment

### Step 1: Run the SQL Script

```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor
Run: sql/94_secure_login_audit_system.sql
```

This creates:
- ✅ `audit_logs` table
- ✅ 7 performance indexes
- ✅ `log_auth_event()` function
- ✅ `cleanup_old_audit_logs()` function
- ✅ RLS policies
- ✅ Helper views
- ✅ Updates to `users` table

### Step 2: Verify Installation

```sql
-- Check if table exists
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM audit_logs;

-- Test logging function
SELECT log_auth_event(
    'login_success',
    NULL,
    'test@example.com',
    'admin',
    'test-session',
    '192.168.1.1',
    'Mozilla/5.0',
    'success',
    NULL,
    NULL
);

-- View recent logs
SELECT * FROM recent_login_attempts LIMIT 10;
```

### Step 3: Frontend Integration (Already Done!)

The login page (`src/app/login.tsx`) has been updated to automatically log:
- ✅ Successful logins
- ✅ Failed login attempts
- ✅ User agent information
- ✅ Last login timestamps

---

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Querying Audit Logs

#### View Recent Login Attempts
```sql
SELECT * FROM recent_login_attempts 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 50;
```

#### Check Suspicious Activity
```sql
SELECT * FROM suspicious_activity 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
```

#### Get Login Statistics by User
```sql
SELECT * FROM user_login_stats 
WHERE user_email = 'admin@vanguardcargo.co';
```

#### Find Failed Login Attempts
```sql
SELECT 
    user_email,
    ip_address,
    error_message,
    created_at
FROM audit_logs
WHERE event_type = 'login_failed'
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

#### Track Login Attempts from Specific IP
```sql
SELECT 
    event_type,
    user_email,
    status,
    created_at
FROM audit_logs
WHERE ip_address = '192.168.1.100'::INET
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

---

## 🔍 Monitoring & Alerts

### Detecting Brute Force Attacks

The system automatically flags suspicious activity when:
- More than 5 failed logins from same IP in 15 minutes
- Risk score automatically set to 75

```sql
-- Find potential brute force attacks
SELECT 
    ip_address,
    COUNT(*) as failed_attempts,
    array_agg(user_email) as attempted_emails,
    MAX(created_at) as last_attempt
FROM audit_logs
WHERE event_type = 'login_failed'
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY ip_address
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5
ORDER BY failed_attempts DESC;
```

### Finding Accounts with Multiple Failed Logins

```sql
SELECT 
    user_email,
    COUNT(*) as failed_logins,
    array_agg(DISTINCT ip_address::TEXT) as ip_addresses,
    MAX(created_at) as last_failed_attempt
FROM audit_logs
WHERE event_type = 'login_failed'
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY user_email
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3
ORDER BY failed_logins DESC;
```

---

## 🧹 Maintenance

### Automatic Cleanup

Logs older than 90 days are automatically marked for deletion. Run cleanup manually:

```sql
SELECT cleanup_old_audit_logs();
```

### Set Up Automated Cleanup (Recommended)

Create a cron job or scheduled task:

```sql
-- Create a scheduled job (if using pg_cron extension)
SELECT cron.schedule(
    'cleanup-audit-logs',
    '0 2 * * *',  -- Run daily at 2 AM
    $$SELECT cleanup_old_audit_logs();$$
);
```

### Custom Retention Policies

```sql
-- Set specific retention for certain events
UPDATE audit_logs 
SET retention_days = 365 
WHERE event_type IN ('unauthorized_access', 'role_changed');

-- Keep suspicious activity longer
UPDATE audit_logs 
SET retention_days = 180 
WHERE is_suspicious = true;
```

---

## 📈 Reports Integration

### Adding Audit Logs to Reports Page

The Reports page can display audit logs for administrators:

```typescript
// In Reports.tsx
const [auditLogs, setAuditLogs] = useState<any[]>([]);

const fetchAuditLogs = async () => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('audit_logs')
    .select('*')
    .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
    .limit(100);
  
  if (data) setAuditLogs(data);
};
```

---

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### ✅ **DO's**
- ✅ Review audit logs regularly
- ✅ Set up alerts for suspicious activity
- ✅ Monitor failed login attempts
- ✅ Keep retention policies appropriate for compliance
- ✅ Export logs for long-term archival if needed
- ✅ Train administrators on log interpretation

### ❌ **DON'Ts**
- ❌ Never log passwords (system doesn't, ensure this continues)
- ❌ Don't expose audit logs to non-admin users
- ❌ Don't modify or delete audit logs manually
- ❌ Don't disable RLS on audit_logs table
- ❌ Don't store unnecessary PII
- ❌ Don't ignore suspicious activity flags

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Login Logging

```bash
# 1. Attempt a successful login
# 2. Check the audit_logs table
# 3. Verify entry was created with correct details

# 4. Attempt a failed login
# 5. Check that failure was logged
# 6. Verify error message was captured
```

### SQL Test Queries

```sql
-- Count total login attempts today
SELECT 
    event_type,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM audit_logs
WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE
AND event_type IN ('login_success', 'login_failed')
GROUP BY event_type;

-- Success rate
SELECT 
    ROUND(
        100.0 * 
        COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE event_type = 'login_success') / 
        COUNT(*),
        2
    ) as success_rate_percent
FROM audit_logs
WHERE event_type IN ('login_success', 'login_failed')
AND created_at >= CURRENT_DATE;
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Logs Not Being Created

1. **Check RPC function exists:**
   ```sql
   SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'log_auth_event';
   ```

2. **Check permissions:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM information_schema.routine_privileges 
   WHERE routine_name = 'log_auth_event';
   ```

3. **Test function directly:**
   ```sql
   SELECT log_auth_event('login_success', NULL, 'test@test.com', 'admin', NULL, '127.0.0.1', 'Test', 'success', NULL, NULL);
   ```

### Can't View Logs

1. **Verify RLS policies:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'audit_logs';
   ```

2. **Check current user role:**
   ```sql
   SELECT role FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid();
   ```
