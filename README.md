# Vanguard Cargo - Warehouse Management System

## Overview

Vanguard Cargo is a warehouse-to-warehouse international cargo platform that enables customers to ship packages from foreign countries to local warehouses for pickup.

## Recent UI Changes

- Navbar
  - Removed the global search bar from `src/components/layout/AppNavbar.tsx`.
  - Implemented live unread notifications count using Supabase on the `notifications` table with real-time updates.
    - Uses `TABLES.NOTIFICATIONS`, filters by `user_id`, `is_read = false`.
    - Subscribes via `subscribeToTable` to refresh count on inserts/updates/deletes.
- Authentication Loader
  - Eliminated the full-screen red "Authenticating..." loader by updating `src/components/RouteGuard.tsx`.
  - The app no longer blocks rendering during auth initialization; redirects happen only after auth state is known.
- Incoming Requests Page
  - Fixed a critical crash on the Incoming Requests page (`src/app/pages/IncomingRequest/IncomingRequest.tsx`) caused by multiple errors, including a `ReferenceError`.
  - Refactored the component to remove mock data and correctly fetch, filter, and display live package data from the `WarehouseService`.
  - Resolved all related type errors and cleaned up unused code.
- Supabase Foreign Key Fix
  - Corrected all Supabase queries in `src/services/WarehouseService.ts` to use the proper syntax for joining the `packages` and `users` tables.
  - This resolves the "Could not find a relationship" error and ensures all package data is fetched correctly.
- Package Intake Suite Number Format
  - Updated package intake interface to accept any suite number format (VC-001, S001, A123, etc.).
  - Previously the UI placeholder suggested only "VC-" format, but the system always supported any format.
  - Updated placeholder text and documentation to clarify format flexibility.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  extends: [
    // Remove ...tseslint.configs.recommended and replace with this
    ...tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked,
    // Alternatively, use this for stricter rules
    ...tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked,
    // Optionally, add this for stylistic rules
    ...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked,
  ],
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})
```

```js
// eslint.config.js
import reactX from 'eslint-plugin-react-x'
import reactDom from 'eslint-plugin-react-dom'

export default tseslint.config({
  plugins: {
    // Add the react-x and react-dom plugins
    'react-x': reactX,
    'react-dom': reactDom,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended typescript rules
    ...reactX.configs['recommended-typescript'].rules,
    ...reactDom.configs.recommended.rules,
  },
})
```
