### Common Issues

**Issue:** "Function verify_delivery_code does not exist"
**Solution:** You need to run earlier migration files first:
1. `sql/62_delivery_auth_code_system.sql`
2. `sql/85_add_delivery_notification.sql`
3. Then `sql/99_fix_shipment_delivery_status.sql`

**Issue:** "Column linked_to_shipment_id does not exist"
**Solution:** Run this first:
- `sql/51_add_waybill_barcode_auth_fields.sql`

**Issue:** Nothing seems to change
**Solution:** 
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Check Supabase logs for errors
3. Verify the SQL ran successfully (check output)
